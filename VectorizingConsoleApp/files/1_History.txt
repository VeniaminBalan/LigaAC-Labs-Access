Timișoara is one of Romania’s oldest and most historically rich cities. It was first mentioned in documents in 1212 and has since been under various rules including the Ottoman Empire, the Habsburg Monarchy, and later Austria-Hungary. It played a significant role in the 1989 Romanian Revolution, becoming the first city to rise against the Communist regime. The city is known as "Little Vienna" due to its architecture and cultural influences.
